#Prototype of Software as a Service Web Application

This web application serves to create an online community of developers, investors, and entrepreneurs to connect with each other. The basic version allows members to view other members on the site. The pro version grants access to other member's contact information.

This project was created to reinforce my Ruby on Rails skills while learning how to use a few new technologies including:

* [Stripe](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-ruby) - payment system processing
* [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) - secure user authentication and registration
* [Paperclip](https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip) - image uploads ( implemented without AWS)
* [Figaro](https://github.com/laserlemon/figaro) - environment variables configuration
* [Bootstrap-sass](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap-sass) - responsive CSS frameworok
* [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) - deployment to web
